The designation does not preclude earning a degree since it is not a program or college-wide requirement. Instead, many students confuse it with the WC Vol-Core requirement, resulting in their disappointment and frustration when they complete a&nbsp;writing-emphasis&nbsp;course but do not receive WC credit. Thus, to simplify the College&rsquo;s curriculum and to clarify its connection with University Vol Core requirements, the College will remove the designation from the Catalog page.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The attached file has the list of all Undergraduate Courses that will have the writing-emphasis designation removed. All departments and colleges with courses in the list have been notified, and any courses that CAS departments requested to have an additional line to replace the writing-emphasis designation have been processed as &quot;UG Revise Course&quot; proposals. Undergraduate courses also listed in the Graduate Catalog have been updated in &quot;Grad Revise Course&quot; proposals.

<h3><strong>Major Requirements and Rules </strong></h3>

<h4><strong>Advising Transition</strong></h4>

<p>Academic advising for freshmen, sophomores, and transfer students in the Sport Management major occurs in the College of Education, Health, and Human Sciences (CEHHS) Office of Advising and Student Services (BEC 332). If you have not been advised by anyone in CEHHS Advising before, please <a href=""https://cehhsadvising.utk.edu/academic-advising/#custom-collapse-1-1"">visit their website</a> for more information about scheduling an appointment with their office. The KRSS Advising Staff is not able to review a student&#39;s academic history if they are not currently a Sport Management major.</p>

<p>A student will transition from CEHHS Advising to KRSS Department Advising after he/she completes the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Maintains a minimum UT GPA of 2.5 after a minimum of 30 hours of coursework</li>

</ul>

<p>At the end of each semester, staff of the CEHHS Office of Advising and Student Services will compile a list of students ready to change to departmental advising. Students will be emailed an advising transition letter with the name and contact information of their new department advisor. Students will then be responsible for scheduling a meeting with their new advisor to complete this transition.

For each student in the program, a graduate advisory committee composed of a minimum of three faculty members must be established before completion of Term 7. To be considered for conditional admission to the program:</p>

<ul>
	<li>A student must be a declared Nutrition major, Biomedical Nutrition Science Concentration, with a minimum GPA of 3.30, must have completed at least 15 credit hours of Nutrition courses, and must have completed at least 90 credit hours of the 120 credit hours of coursework required for the BS degree with a major in Nutrition.</li>
	<li>A student must provide three letters of support from Nutrition faculty members serving on the graduate and undergraduate committees</li>
	<li>A student must obtain a commitment from a Nutrition graduate research faculty member to serve as their graduate mentor-advisor (i.e., major professor) and as the chair of their graduate advisory committee.</li>
	<li>The Department may consider other relevant factors such as an applicant&#39;s work experience and level of maturity before conditionally admitting a student to the BS/MS program. Conditional admission of a student into the 5-year BS/MS program must be approved by both the Department of Nutrition and the Graduate School. Students will be typically informed of the outcome of their application before they start their senior year of undergraduate study.</li>
</ul>

<p>Any graduate course taken before satisfying all requirements for the BS degree must be approved by the student&#39;s graduate advisory committee, the Director of Graduate Studies, and the Graduate School. These graduate courses must be identified in advance in consultation with the undergraduate advisor and the graduate advisory committee.</p>

<p>A student that is conditionally admitted to the BS-MS program may complete up to 9 credit hours of graduate level coursework during the student&#39;s undergraduate study and apply those 9 credit hours to satisfy both the BS degree requirements and also the MS degree requirements, provided that these graduate credit hours were approved by both the Department and by the Graduate School.</p>

<p>The form &quot;Nutrition Conditional Admission 5 Year BS-MS&quot; is available from the Director of Graduate Studies and must be completed and signed by the undergraduate advisor, undergraduate coordinator, and graduate advisory committee by May 1 of their junior year.

<p>To receive graduate credit for the 9 credit hours listed on the Nutrition Conditional Admission Form and approved by their graduate advisory committee, and others granting approval by signing that form, the student must complete and submit the Senior Requesting Graduate Credit Form to the Graduate School. If the graduate courses are to be taken during different semesters, the student will need to submit this form per each relevant semester.</p>

<p>Conditional admission into the BS/MS program does not guarantee acceptance into either the Graduate School or the MS program. Students in the BS/MS program must submit an application for admission to the Office of Graduate Admissions and to the MS program during their senior year of undergraduate study for the term immediately following the completion of their undergraduate study, following the same procedures of all other student applicants.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><u>Rationale for removing FDSC 415</u>: The decision to remove FDSC 415 from the dietetics curriculum as an option to fulfill the &ldquo;food science&rdquo; required element is supported by the Department of Food Science. This decision aims to ensure that the available course options optimally address the essential learning elements for aspiring dietetics professionals. The low enrollment of dietetic students in FDSC 415, coupled with its lack of coverage of fundamental food science principles compared to other available courses, further justifies its exclusion. The recent addition of HTM 101 as an alternative option enhances our capacity to streamline and improve the curriculum by eliminating FDSC 415 as a choice (see attached document demonstrating the approval from the Food Science Department).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><u>Rationale for adding </u><strong>NUTR 216 or AGNR 180 on the list with an asterisk denoting fulfillment of the GCI requirement.</strong>: Requiring dietetics students to choose between NUTR 216 and AGNR 180 to fulfill the &ldquo;Global Citizenship &ndash; International&rdquo; VolCore requirement better fulfills both the &ldquo;global nutrition&rdquo; and &ldquo;environmental sustainability&rdquo; required elements of the accredited undergraduate dietetics curriculum. Currently, these required elements are found minimally in other coursework, and this change would provide a better exposure to these required elements of the dietetics curriculum.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><u>Rationale for</u><strong> Substituting &quot;KNS 350&quot; with the option &quot;KNS 250, KNS 350, or NUTR 200</strong>: Incorporating KNS 250 and NUTR 200 as alternatives, in addition to KNS 350, for the physical activity course in the dietetics undergraduate curriculum offers students a broader range of choices. Notably, the inclusion of KNS 250 enhances the synergy between the Nutrition-Dietetics major and the Nutrition and Physical Activity for Health minor. Unlike the previous scenario where only KNS 350 was available, the expanded options now fulfill the necessary physical activity component in the curriculum. Detailed discussions in email threads support the rationale behind including both courses (see attached document demonstrating the approval from the Kinesiology Department).</p>

As a result, the formerly constituted ECE programs at the undergraduate level will be moved to TPTE as Education Majors with a BS in Education. The program name needed to be revised in order to align with the change in prefixes for courses in the ECE program (from CFS to IEC). None of the program requirements or courses will change. Only the name of the major will be adjusted, as well as the name of the concentration, and it will then be moved to TPTE under an existing major. These changes have been done in consultation with Associate Dean David Cihak, Dr. Lynn Hodge (TPTE DH), and the CFS ECE program faculty. Karen Galicia indicated that we do not need THEC approval in order to make these program adjustments and to move the programs to TPTE. These changes have also been done under the direction and guidance of Jonathan Hughes with the registrar&#39;s office.&nbsp;</p>

The early childhood education licensure option is offered in conjunction with a master&#39;s degree in Theory and Practice in Teacher Education&nbsp;(Interdisciplinary Early Childhood Integrated PreK-3). The Interdisciplinary Early Childhood Concentration (Integrated PreK-3 Fifth Year Internship Specialization) is&nbsp;designed with an emphasis on an inclusive, unified, and integrated curriculum in which early childhood and special education content are purposefully blended into courses/clinical experiences in the early childhood and elementary classroom. The overarching goal of the program is to prepare candidates to teach all children from an integrated lens through which early childhood and special education are no longer viewed as separate. The program objectives center on preparing candidates who understand children and families in a cultural context to meet a diverse set of needs (i.e., racial, linguistic, economic, and ability) across a range of early childhood settings. The strength of the program includes a series of integrated early childhood and special education clinical experiences that happen &quot;early and often,&quot; from which candidates benefit from hands-on practical experiences that use an embedded instruction approach with principles of universal design.</p>

<p>The PreK-3 teacher candidates must complete university-required general education courses in the first terms of their program. The education core comprises courses in educational psychology, educational technology, and an introductory-level special education course. TPTE has additional integrated early childhood core courses that are required of candidates and focus solely on the scope of an integrated early childhood program to teach children from birth to grade 3. These courses provide foundational knowledge of integrated curriculum and blended designs for teaching young children, partnering with families, and collaboration with professionals in the community. The PreK-3 teacher candidates&#39; graduate level clinical experience consists of a full academic year (fall and spring semesters) internship in public school settings (kindergarten to grade 3) under the guidance and supervision of a professional team that has knowledge of an integrated and blended program design.</p>

As a result, the formerly constituted ECE programs at the undergraduate level will be moved to TPTE as Education Majors with a BS in Education. The program name needed to be revised in order to align with the change in prefixes for courses in the ECE program (from CFS to IEC). None of the program requirements or courses will change. Only the name of the major will be adjusted, as well as the name of the concentration, and it will then be moved to TPTE under an existing major. These changes have been done in consultation with Associate Dean David Cihak, Dr. Lynn Hodge (TPTE DH), and the CFS ECE program faculty. Karen Galicia indicated that we do not need THEC approval in order to make these program adjustments and to move the programs to TPTE. These changes have also been done under the direction and guidance of Jonathan Hughes with the registrar&#39;s office.&nbsp;</p>

The Interdisciplinary Early Childhood Integrated B-K track is a concentration designed with an emphasis on an inclusive, unified, and integrated curriculum in which early childhood and special education content are purposefully blended into courses/clinical experiences. The overarching goal of this program is to prepare candidates to teach all children from an integrated lens through which early childhood and special education are no longer viewed as separate. The program objectives center on preparing candidates who understand children and families in a cultural context to meet a diverse set of needs (i.e., racial, linguistic, economic, and ability) across a range of early childhood settings. The strength of the program includes a series of integrated early childhood and special education clinical experiences that happen &quot;early and often,&quot; from which candidates benefit from hands-on practical experiences that use an embedded instruction approach with principles of universal design. Outside of the Vol Core curriculum, courses in this program are offered in distance education and campus-based formats to allow for enrollment of both types of students.</p>

<p>Interdisciplinary Early Childhood Integrated B-K candidates must complete university-required general education courses in the first terms of their program. The education core comprises courses in educational psychology, educational technology, and an introductory-level special education course. TPTE has additional integrated early childhood core courses that are required of candidates and focus solely on the scope of an integrated early childhood program age range (birth to kindergarten). These courses provide foundational knowledge of integrated curriculum and blended designs for teaching young children, partnering with families, and collaboration with professionals in the community. B-K candidates complete clinical experiences in a variety of collaborative and inclusive early childhood settings (birth to age 3; 3 to 5 years old). The student teaching course is the culminating/capstone full-time clinical practice for candidates that also includes a seminar experience.</p>

<h3>Learning Objective for Interdisciplinary Early Childhood Integrated B-K (Birth to Kindergarten) Concentration</h3>

<ol>
	<li>Demonstrate expertise in Integrated Early Childhood Education birth to kindergarten content and child-centered pedagogy.</li>
	<li>Provide research-based instruction and leadership in recognition and support of accountability measures facing today&#39;s educators.</li>
	<li>Engage as active members of learning communities through a commitment to ongoing professional development and collaboration.</li>
	<li>Actively pursue evidenced-based initiatives in educational settings to promote continuous improvement to instruction that facilitates learning for all stakeholders.</li>
	<li>Model the professional dispositions that are characteristic of successful educators.</li>
	<li>Value diversity among students, colleagues, community members, and others by promoting diversity as a means for strengthening the educational experiences of all students.</li>
	<li>Demonstrate those skills necessary to promote continuous improvements to curriculum, instruction, use of high quality instructional materials, and the use of technology and assessment.</li>
</ol>

<h3><strong>Progression Requirements </strong></h3>

<p>Students interested in this licensure should work closely with their advisor to ensure that they understand and meet Teacher Education program requirements and that they strictly follow the application process.

Haslam's International Business degree is designed to accompany a second major within the Haslam College of Business, which equips them with specific functional skills that enhance their effectiveness as business professionals, while incorporating advanced foreign language requirements and a mandatory semester study abroad experience. Students will develop their international business knowledge, their intercultural fluencies, their technical functional skills, and their communication skills in both English and their chosen second language.</p><p>In addition to the double major, students are also required to complete a collateral in a foreign language. This collateral requires at least three courses at the 300+ level. Proficiency in a foreign language is integral to understanding social and historical nuances for foreign cultures. It also positions students to better integrate into their host countries and build meaningful working relationships and successful transcontinental careers.</p><p>Finally, students are also required to study abroad for a full semester in an approved destination and program. Through the study abroad requirement, students will gain a deeper knowledge, understanding, and open-mindedness for other cultures and their shared behaviors, beliefs and values. They will also develop different perspectives in regard to other nations and global issues while expanding their capacity to consider, appreciate, and analyze issues for different and even competing viewpoints.</p><p>Given the requirements for completion of all aspects of this degree, students must apply for and gain acceptance into the major to ensure appropriate and on-time progression through the coursework.

Since the last offering of BSET 202 in 2019, The University of Tennessee, Knoxville has become one of only nine institutions with agricultural education programs that does not offer a lab-based course dedicated to the competencies necessary to teach agricultural mechanics.

Boyer, DeLong, Lay, and Walton</p><p>Students majoring in food and agricultural business are prepared for a wide variety of career opportunities. The focus of their studies is on the functioning of the agri-food sector in the global economic system and the economic principles for decision making by business managers, consumers, policymakers, and others within that sector. Students complete a curriculum designed to provide them with a broad-based education and the specialized skills necessary for a successful career in the agri-food industry or with a related organization or public agency. The curriculum builds upon the university-wide general education requirements by adding a set of directed electives from within the Herbert College of Agriculture, a set of core courses from within the Haslam College of Business, and a set of required courses within the Department of Agricultural <span>and Resource Economics. Students customize their program by selecting among upper-division electives within the department. General elective hours in the curriculum allow flexibility for students to pursue a minor within some area of technical agriculture or another field such as communications. Students have ample opportunity to develop strong microcomputer skills and gain practical real-world experiences through case study analyses, the NAMA marketing team, internships, and extracurricular activities. Students must complete an experiential learning requirement involving either an internship, an undergraduate research project, or a study abroad experience.</span></p><p>Students graduating with a major in food and agricultural business have many career options. Many graduates take positions in management or marketing with businesses involved in the farm input supply sector. This would include large multinational corporations that manufacture inputs such as machinery, chemicals, and feed, as well as local retailers of such items. Other graduates manage operations involved in the production of agricultural commodities or the processing of food products. Graduates also find career opportunities with food distribution and retailing companies serving as managers, marketing representatives, or in areas of customer service and public relations. Graduates are employed in financial institutions, insurance agencies, or real estate companies. Many industry organizations and government agencies also have employment opportunities for our graduates. It is not uncommon for our graduates to take positions with businesses that are outside the agri-food industry. Graduates also find themselves well prepared for graduate study in agricultural <span>and resource economics or agribusiness management, as well as for professional programs such as law.</span></p><p>Students who wish to target a specific career direction can choose to pursue one of the four optional concentrations: Agricultural Production and Technology Management, Law and Policy, Finance and Risk Management, and Food Industry Management. Because each of these concentrations requires students to complete a more specific set of courses than the base major, students must work closely with their advisor to assure that they schedule required courses prior to their planned graduation date. Many required courses are offered only once per academic year, while a few are offered only every other year. Students unable to complete the required courses as listed for one of the optional concentrations for any reason (e.g., scheduling conflicts with alternate-year courses) will revert to using the base Food and Agricultural Business major.<strong><a name=""uTrack""></a></strong></p>",,31555,Active-Visible,,,,,,,,,,,,82,2024-2025 UG Revise Program,,4580052.118048,"[{'id': 6, 'name': 'Agricultural and Resource Economics'}]",stuck,2023-08-04T11:52:10,443,"Herbert College of Agriculture - Agricultural and Resource Economics - Food and Agricultural Business Major, BS in Agricultural and Resource Economics",active,program,21693,UG Curriculum Committee,current,https://utk.curriculog.com/proposal:579/form,0,jcwalton@utk.edu,Jonathan,0,Walton,active,

The form ""Agricultural and Resource Economics Conditional Admission Five-Year BS-MS"" is available from the Graduate Director and must be completed, signed by the student and the Graduate Director before submitting to the Graduate School for approval and processing. The University of Tennessee, Knoxville Senior Privilege rule imposes a maximum of 9 hours on the number of graduate-level hours that an undergraduate student may complete before completing an undergraduate degree and being formally admitted to the Graduate School. A student who is conditionally admitted to the BS-MS Program completes 9 hours of graduate credit during the student's fourth year of undergraduate study, and applies those 9 hours to satisfy both BS and MS degree requirements.</p><p>Conditional admission into the BS-MS Program does not guarantee acceptance into either the Graduate School or the MS Program. Students in the BS-MS Program must apply for admission to the Graduate School and to the MS Program during their fourth year of undergraduate study, following the same procedures that all other student applicants follow. Students will be fully admitted to the MS Program after they have been accepted both by the Graduate School and by the MS Program in Agricultural and Resource Economics.

<p>The Bachelor of Science in Construction Science and Management prepares students for entry into the very broad and diverse range of careers related to construction, including residential, agricultural, commercial, roadway, and excavation construction. Students in this program typically enjoy the outdoors and the sense of accomplishment that comes from seeing a project grow from an idea to a finished product. This field relies on knowledge from engineering, technology, construction, and business, and combines those with important skills related to teamwork and leadership. The program provides a strong background in science and math, adds fundamental concepts from engineering, and provides exposure to relevant technology and techniques such as CAD, land surveying, and estimating. The major focuses on specific technical areas providing the skills required to manage the sophisticated technological systems increasingly essential in today&#39;s construction world. Coursework in economics and the management of a small business are also included, along with oral and written communication. This program is designed to be less theoretical, more applied, and focused on the broad range of management opportunities within the construction industry.</p>

<p>Transfer or change of major students seeking admission into the Construction Science and Management degree program must be in good academic standing (2.00 or higher in the UT system).</p>

<p>Proper selection of business-related elective courses in the Construction Science and Management program may meet the coursework requirements for a Minor in Business Administrationor or for a Minor in Agricultural Business. This business background is supplemented with courses addressing construction-specific issues in accounting, finance, and law. Issues related to green/sustainable construction practices are also covered. Students are encouraged to identify experiences in construction practice such as internships or part time/summer work, which is facilitated through the very active Construction Science Student Club.<strong><a name=""uTrack""></a></strong></p>

Further, scientific investigations are currently proving the purported health benefits associated with consumption of fermented foods. It is then expected that the demand for fermented foods will continue to increase driven by multiculturality of the world and beneficial health effects of fermented foods consumption being better established.

Use of these spaces for outdoor recreation can results in life enriching experiences for individuals and communities alike. Balancing use and protection of these valuable resources is challenging and requires the best efforts of dedicated professionals. The Outdoor Recreation and Park Management (ORPM) major will provide the highest level of professional training for students seeking employment in the park management field and those interested in tapping into the growing outdoor recreation economy.</p>

<p><br />
The ORPM curriculum prepares students for careers as professionals in a variety of natural resource management agencies, non-profits, and small business operations. Many employment opportunities are in the public sector, including such agencies as the National Park Service, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the USDA Forest Service, state park departments, and city and county park and recreation departments. Students may also seek employment with non-profits such as the Nature Conservancy, Wilderness Society, and the Sierra Club. &nbsp;Additionally, the ORPM major will provide student will the necessary skills to be a part of the outdoor recreation economy through entrepreneurial training.</p>

<p><br />
Graduates are employed as park managers, rangers, conservation officers, planners, naturalists, agency and unit directors, program specialists, outfitter owners/managers, small business owners and in other areas of outdoor recreation.</p>

<p><br />
The university has over 21,000 acres of forest land available for teaching, research, and demonstration for ORPM majors.

",,,,,,,Credit (CR),,,,,,,,,,,"<p>This course will introduce students to fundamental ethical and social issues related to the design, development, and use of technology. Students will develop an understanding of philosophical ethical theories as a resource for analyzing how technology impacts both individual and collective civil, political, and human rights and issues related to autonomy, privacy, and identity.&nbsp; Versions of this course are increasingly common in Philosophy departments at peer and aspiring-peer institutions.&nbsp; Philosophers are ideally situated to help students understand and reflect on ethical issues raised by emerging technologies.&nbsp; It is a timely course that will contribute to the Gen. Ed. Curriculum and attract students to Philosophy programs.&nbsp; It will enhance our new Philosophy of Science and Medicine Minor. It does not significantly overlap with our current course offerings (PHIL244 focuses on ethical issues in business, medicine, and other professions, while PHIL252 focuses on abortion, the death penalty, etc.).</p>

<p>The course will help students to accurately explain and critically evaluate philosophical texts and ideas.&nbsp; It will enhance their understanding of philosophical texts and ideas.&nbsp; It will also enhance their critical thinking skills.&nbsp; This course fits well with our existing lower-division undergraduate courses, especially our courses in Professional Responsibility, Contemporary Moral Problems, and Critical Thinking.&nbsp; It also fits squarely in our new minor in Philosophy of Science and Medicine, which requires 6 courses at the 200-level and above.&nbsp; And it will attract students to our major, including our Philosophy of Science and Medicine and Legal and Political Philosophy concentrations.</p>

<p>Our Assessment Activities include planning and implementing strategies for enhancing the Gen.Ed. curriculum through courses that emphasize the need for philosophical reflection on issues of pressing social interest.&nbsp; We also work to increase the number of Philosophy majors and minors and to complement other programs at the University.&nbsp; We hope to fill a gap at UTK that has been recently created by the explosion of AI and the important ethical issues it raises.&nbsp; We also hope to expose students to Philosophy more generally and to emphasize its practical implications.</p>
","<p>The course will complement computer science, neuroscience, and other programs by providing ethics training in these areas.&nbsp; There is no comparable course of this sort at UTK.</p>
","<p>Neutral.&nbsp;&nbsp;Philosophy will be able to field these courses from the existing tenure-stream faculty and lecturers.&nbsp; Adam Cureton (Professor) has research interests in this field and some informal computer science background.&nbsp; The course can also be taught by several other TT faculty and lecturers with interests in practical ethics.&nbsp; If the course is successful, we would ideally hire a TT faculty member who specializes in the ethics of emerging technologies.</p>

EF 320, which is currently being taught as EF 327 -Honors: Engineering Design in K-12 Education will switch to the EF 320 course number/prefix in order to remove the honors concentration and become more inclusive to any engineering student that might be interested in service-learning and experiential education. The EF 320 course number/prefix is already available within the course catalog for 2023-2024 but is not currently being used as a course within the engineering fundamentals department.</p>

<p>The current course, EF 327-Honors: Engineering Design in K-12 Education, which meets simultaneously with TPTE 115 within the College of Education, Health, and Human Sciences offers engineering students and students enrolled in STEM fields of the teacher education program the experience to work within their community in the setting of K-12 education and outreach. The course provides students the opportunity to apply the human-centered design process and reflection to various service projects that are partnered with such organizations as the Knox County School District, TN STEM Hub, 4-H organizations across the state, and the Boys &amp; Girls club. Following each service-learning project, the enrolled students will be expected to submit a written reflection via their course CANVAS site. In addition to the service projects and events, students will also practice teaching etiquette and procedures during their weekly class meetings on campus. Furthermore, students will learn basic education theory and read current scholarly articles on research based practices to teach engineering in K-12.</p>
","<p>It should be noted that while the course meets concurrently with TPTE 115, the service-learning designation will have no effect on their course number or content, as they are not considered cross-listed within the university&rsquo;s undergraduate catalog.</p>

			<p>University Honors serves a diverse group of highly accomplished, intellectually curious, and action-oriented students from across the university&rsquo;s undergraduate colleges. The interdisciplinary and collaborative University Honors experience is designed to complement the depth of learning provided in students&#39; academic disciplines. University Honors brings together a community of Honors students, staff, faculty eager to learn together, hone their abilities to address complex problems,&nbsp;and make a positive difference on campus, in Tennessee, and beyond.</p>

			<p>University Honors offers two programs: Chancellor&#39;s Honors and Haslam Leadership Scholars. Each program has its own eligibility requirements, program goals, and academic curriculum (see Academic Minor links below). Chancellor&#39;s Honors and Haslam Leadership Scholars are encouraged and supported to deepen their honors experience by participating fully in campus life, serving the community, and pursuing experiential learning opportunities, such as internships, research, and study abroad. University Honors students are also encouraged to participate in one or more of the University of Tennessee&#39;s many specialized&nbsp;<a href=""https://studentsuccess.utk.edu/honors/college-and-departmental-honors-programs/"">college and departmental honors programs</a>.</p>

			<p>University Honors students are expected to make timely progress towards honors graduation while maintaining a minimum cumulative GPA of 3.5. Students not meeting expectations will be required to complete supplemental academic coaching with University Honors staff.</p>

			<p>Benefits</p>

			<p>Students in University Honors enjoy various privileges designed to facilitate their growth, learning, and achievement. University Honors students are granted priority registration, advanced library privileges, and specialized honors coaching to ensure access to the coursework and resources that an ambitious curriculum demands. In addition, University Honors students have access to exclusive study spaces and honors programming, competitive honors grants and scholarships, and the opportunity to live in the University Honors Living and Learning Community in their first year.&nbsp;In recognition of their exceptional academic achievement, University&nbsp;Honors students receive special graduation accolades.</p>

			<p>Eligibility</p>

			<p>Eligibility for University Honors programs is as follows:</p>

			<p>Chancellor&#39;s Honors: High school seniors with superior academic and extracurricular credentials are invited to apply to the Chancellor&#39;s Honors Program. Current first- year students, as well as qualified transfer students, are also eligible to apply for membership.</p>

			<p>Haslam Leadership Scholars: Only high school seniors are eligible to apply to Haslam Leadership Scholars. Highly accomplished students with demonstrated commitment to leadership, service, and civic engagement and who aspire to leverage their leadership to enrich the lives of the people and communities across the state of Tennessee and beyond are strongly encouraged to apply.</p>
